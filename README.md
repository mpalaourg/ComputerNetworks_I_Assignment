<p align="justify">
This is an <i>experimental</i> application developed as part of the course "Computer Networks I" assignment, that took place in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in 2018.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The goal of the Assignment was to establish connection with "Ithaki" Server, send (byte-byte) requests for packages and receive them. Those packages, were:
<ul>
<li> Echo packages, with a specific format. </li>
<li> Image packages, received and save as .jpeg files. </li>
<li> Global Positioning System (GPS) traces, received and printed on a (satelite) image. </li>
